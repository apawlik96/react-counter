# Task: Implement a Simple Counter in React

## Objective

The goal of this task is to help you understand the basics of React components, state management, and event handling. You will create a simple counter application that allows users to increment and decrement a counter value by clicking buttons.

## Requirements

### Create the Counter Component

- Inside the `src` folder, create a new file named `Counter.js`.
- Define a functional component named `Counter`.

### Implement State Management

- Use the `useState` hook to manage the counter state within the `Counter` component.
- Initialize the counter state to 0.

### Display the `Counter`

- In the `Counter` component, display the current value of the counter.

### Add Increment (+) and Decrement (-) Buttons

- Add two buttons to the Counter component: one for incrementing and one for decrementing the counter value.
- Each button should have an onClick event handler that updates the counter state accordingly.

### Handle Edge Cases

- Ensure the counter does not go below 0.

### Bonus

- Add a reset button that sets the counter back to 0.

## Help

If this is your first time with React ever, the `Counter.js` file is already there with some basic scaffolding to help you kick off. Otherwise you can delete this file and start from scratch!
